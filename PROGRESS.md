## Progress Log

## 2025-07-28 - Initial Development Structure Setup
**Type**: Architecture  
**Impact**: High

Created comprehensive development tracking system for the CV repository:

1. **TODO.md** - Task lifecycle management with clear states (PENDING → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Substantial updates and important notes documentation
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated to reference both tracking files

This establishes a structured approach for future development work, ensuring continuity between different Claude instances working on the project.

**Related Files**:
- TODO.md (new)
- PROGRESS.md (new) 
- CLAUDE.md (updated)

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Single task IN PROGRESS rule to maintain focus
- Clear task format with priority, effort estimation, and acceptance criteria
- Separation of concerns: TODO.md for task tracking, PROGRESS.md for substantial updates
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md documentation

**Next Steps**:
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md to reference new tracking files
- [x] Begin populating TODO.md with actual project tasks

## 2025-07-28 - Complete Task Organization and Custom Command Setup
**Type**: Architecture  
**Impact**: High

Major progress on task management and workflow automation:

1. **Complete Task Extraction** - Successfully parsed user's Todoist output to extract full task hierarchy:
   - 16 main CV tasks identified and categorized
   - 10-item "CV feedback" sublist properly structured
   - Clear separation between coding tasks (implementable by Claude) and IRL tasks (user action required)

2. **Enhanced Task Structure** - Organized TODO.md with proper categorization:
   - Coding tasks section for Claude-implementable work
   - IRL tasks section for user-driven activities (social media, content creation)
   - CV feedback implementation tasks as priority items

3. **Custom Command Creation** - Built `/progress` slash command for workflow efficiency:
   - Eliminates need to retype progress update requests
   - Streamlines the update → commit workflow
   - Provides consistent approach for future sessions

**Related Files**:
- TODO.md (major updates with all extracted tasks)
- extracted-tasks-raw.md (new - audit trail)
- .claude/commands/progress.md (new - custom command)
- CLAUDE.md (updated with quick start workflow)

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Separated atomic coding tasks from user action items
- CV feedback items prioritized as high-impact quick wins
- Task extraction documented for future reference
- Workflow automation via custom commands

**Impact Assessment**:
The repository now has a complete, actionable task structure with 26 total tasks properly categorized and prioritized. The custom `/progress` command creates a sustainable workflow for ongoing development sessions.
