## Progress Log

## 2025-07-28 - Development Tracking System
**Type**: Architecture  
**Impact**: High

Task management system established with TODO.md and PROGRESS.md. Custom commands updated for concise workflow.

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Single task IN PROGRESS rule
- Separated coding vs user action tasks
- Commands streamlined per user style preferences

## 2025-07-28 - PDF Download Feature Implementation
**Type**: Dependency/Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

Successfully implemented PDF download functionality with library migration from html2pdf.js to jsPDF + html2canvas due to blank page issues.

**Key Changes**:

- Fixed React 18 warnings (ReactDOM.render â†’ createRoot)
- Implemented ghost button design with proper hover effects
- Resolved blank page issue with exact dimension calculations
- A4 width with 0.5" margins and dynamic height based on content

## 2025-07-28 - TODO.md Restructure
**Type**: Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

Reorganized TODO.md with cleaner structure: Next/Backlog/IRL sections. Removed priority labels from task items for cleaner readability.

**Changes**:
- Created "Next" section for immediate development tasks
- Moved content modification tasks to "Backlog" 
- Removed redundant priority indicators
- Identified duplicate tasks (JSON loading vs hardcoded content extraction)

## 2025-07-28 - GitHub Link Button with Scroll Fade
**Type**: Feature/Performance
**Impact**: Low

Added GitHub repository link button with scroll-based fade animation matching PDF download button styling.

**Key Implementation**:
- SVG GitHub icon positioned next to PDF button
- Shared opacity fade effect on scroll (0-300px range)
- React hooks for scroll event handling with cleanup
- Consistent styling and transitions with existing UI
