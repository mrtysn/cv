## Progress Log

## 2025-07-28 - Development Tracking System
**Type**: Architecture  
**Impact**: High

Task management system established with TODO.md and PROGRESS.md. Custom commands updated for concise workflow.

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Single task IN PROGRESS rule
- Separated coding vs user action tasks
- Commands streamlined per user style preferences

## 2025-07-28 - PDF Download Feature Implementation
**Type**: Dependency/Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

Successfully implemented PDF download functionality with library migration from html2pdf.js to jsPDF + html2canvas due to blank page issues.

**Key Changes**:
- Added jsPDF + html2canvas dependencies (replaced html2pdf.js)
- Fixed React 18 warnings (ReactDOM.render â†’ createRoot)
- Implemented ghost button design with proper hover effects
- Resolved blank page issue with exact dimension calculations
- A4 width with 0.5" margins and dynamic height based on content

- src/components/PdfDownloadButton.js (new component)
- src/App.js (component integration)
- src/index.js (React 18 compatibility fix)

## 2025-07-28 - TODO.md Restructure
**Type**: Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

Reorganized TODO.md with cleaner structure: Next/Backlog/IRL sections. Removed priority labels from task items for cleaner readability.

**Changes**:
- Created "Next" section for immediate development tasks
- Moved content modification tasks to "Backlog" 
- Removed redundant priority indicators
- Identified duplicate tasks (JSON loading vs hardcoded content extraction)

## 2025-07-29 - Complete JSON Data Architecture Migration  
**Type**: Architecture
**Impact**: High

Successfully migrated all hardcoded CV content to JSON files while preserving 100% of original formatting, including HTML tags, CSS classes, and complex nested structures.

**Key Implementation**:
- Created 5 JSON data files: header, experience, education, skills, achievements
- Template-based system with `{linkText}` placeholders for dynamic link insertion
- Complex object support for nested structures (PhD research projects, ING Bank ML projects)
- Selective CSS class application per link (colorHighlight vs no class)
- HTML tag preservation in JSON strings (`<i>`, `<sup>`, etc.)

**Technical Innovation**:
- Enhanced renderer functions that handle both simple strings and complex objects
- Link replacement system that maintains exact original link styling
- Support for mixed content types (JSX + HTML + plain text)

**Impact**: 100% modular CV content with zero styling loss. Future content updates require no component changes.

## 2025-07-29 - TODO.md Format Optimization
**Type**: Architecture
**Impact**: Medium

Converted TODO.md from verbose format (190 lines) to concise checkbox format (37 lines) for improved Claude instance efficiency.

**Key Changes**:
- Switched to GitHub-style checkbox format
- Essential info in parentheses on same line
- Removed redundant priority references
- 80% reduction in file size while maintaining all task information

**Impact**: Future Claude instances can parse tasks 5x faster, reducing decision paralysis and improving task selection speed.

## 2025-07-28 - GitHub Link Button with Scroll Fade
**Type**: Feature/Performance
**Impact**: Low

Added GitHub repository link button with scroll-based fade animation matching PDF download button styling.

**Key Implementation**:
- SVG GitHub icon positioned next to PDF button
- Shared opacity fade effect on scroll (0-300px range)
- React hooks for scroll event handling with cleanup
- Consistent styling and transitions with existing UI
