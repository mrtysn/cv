## Progress Log

## 2025-07-28 - Initial Development Structure Setup
**Type**: Architecture  
**Impact**: High

Created comprehensive development tracking system for the CV repository:

1. **TODO.md** - Task lifecycle management with clear states (PENDING → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
2. **PROGRESS.md** - Substantial updates and important notes documentation
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Updated to reference both tracking files

This establishes a structured approach for future development work, ensuring continuity between different Claude instances working on the project.

**Related Files**:
- TODO.md (new)
- PROGRESS.md (new) 
- CLAUDE.md (updated)

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Single task IN PROGRESS rule to maintain focus
- Clear task format with priority, effort estimation, and acceptance criteria
- Separation of concerns: TODO.md for task tracking, PROGRESS.md for substantial updates
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md documentation

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md to reference new tracking files
- [ ] Begin populating TODO.md with actual project tasks
