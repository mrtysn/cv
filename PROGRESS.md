## 2025-08-12 - Link Preview Implementation Removed
**Type**: Breaking Change
**Impact**: Low

Implemented and immediately removed link preview functionality per user preference. Attempted multiple screenshot services (screenshotone, microlink.io, thum.io) - all had API limitations. Reverted all components (Header, Footer, GitHub button, Experience/Education renderers, Achievements) back to standard anchor tags. Bundle size reduced by 1.28kB. Lesson: validate user requirements before implementing complex UI features.

**Impact**: High

TODO.md and PROGRESS.md established. Single task rule.

## 2025-07-28 - PDF Download Implementation
**Impact**: Medium

jsPDF + html2canvas. Fixed blank page issue. React 18 compatibility.

## 2025-07-28 - TODO.md Restructure

80% size reduction. GitHub-style checkboxes for faster Claude parsing.

## 2025-07-29 - Button Scroll Behavior: 100-0-100 Pattern

## 2025-08-12 - GitHub Icon Enhancement & UI Refinements
**Type**: UI/UX Improvement
**Impact**: Medium

Enhanced GitHub icon with outline/filled hover states using custom SVG files. Replaced traditional borders with `box-shadow` technique (0.5px inset shadow) for precise border control on PDF download button. Added dynamic PDF filename with version number (`Mert_Yasin_CV_v3_3.pdf`). Improved print styling with `!important` rules. Key learning: box-shadow borders bypass CSS cascading issues better than traditional borders.

## 2025-08-12 - GitHub Actions PDF Pipeline with Interactive Links
**Type**: Architecture
**Impact**: High

Implemented complete PDF generation pipeline using GitHub Actions + Puppeteer to solve the core issue of non-working links in PDFs. Added smart download system: GitHub Releases API â†’ local fallback. Created `/scripts/generate-pdf.js` with optimized Puppeteer settings for CI/CD. Added Puppeteer as dev dependency for local interactive PDF generation via `pnpm run generate-pdf`. System automatically creates versioned releases with working PDF links on every master push. Key insight: Puppeteer preserves HTML structure including clickable links, unlike html2canvas which creates static images.

## 2025-08-13 - GitHub Actions PNPM Configuration Fix
**Type**: Config
**Impact**: Medium

Fixed GitHub Actions failure caused by setup-node@v4 expecting npm/yarn lock files when project uses pnpm. Added pnpm/action-setup@v2 step and updated all package manager commands from npm to pnpm. Removed npm cache configuration from setup-node step. Essential for CI/CD pipeline functionality.
