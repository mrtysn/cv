# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start - Essential Workflow

**ALWAYS START HERE** when beginning work on this repository:

1. **Read TODO.md** - Check current tasks and their status
2. **Mark task IN PROGRESS** - Update chosen task status before starting work
3. **Work atomically** - Focus on single, well-defined tasks only
4. **Document substantial changes** - Update PROGRESS.md for significant findings
5. **Mark COMPLETED** - Update task status immediately when finished

**Key Rules**:
- ✅ Only ONE task IN PROGRESS at a time
- ✅ Tasks must be atomic (single-session completable)
- ✅ Always update TODO.md status before and after work
- ✅ Use PROGRESS.md for architectural decisions and discoveries
- ❌ No time estimates - focus on granular task breakdown instead

**Essential Files**: TODO.md (task tracking) | PROGRESS.md (substantial updates) | This file (guidance)

## Common Development Commands

### Local Development
- `pnpm install` - Install dependencies
- `pnpm run start` - Start development server at localhost:3000
- `pnpm run build` - Build production version

### Deployment
- `pnpm run predeploy` - Build before deployment (runs `pnpm run build`)
- `pnpm run deploy` - Deploy to GitHub Pages using gh-pages

### Package Manager
This project uses **pnpm** (not npm or yarn). Always use `pnpm` for package management.

## Development Tracking

This repository uses structured task and progress tracking:

### TODO.md - Task Management
- **Primary task tracking** - Use this for all development work
- **Task lifecycle**: PENDING → IN PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- **Important**: Always mark tasks as IN PROGRESS before starting work
- **Rule**: Only work on ONE task at a time (single IN PROGRESS task)
- Each task includes priority, effort estimation, and acceptance criteria

### PROGRESS.md - Substantial Updates
- **Document significant changes** - Architecture decisions, important discoveries
- **Track breaking changes** - Performance improvements, new dependencies
- **Current task notes** - Use for complex tasks requiring detailed notes
- **Maintain context** - Helps future instances understand project evolution

### Workflow
1. Check TODO.md for current tasks
2. Mark chosen task as IN PROGRESS
3. Work on the task
4. Document substantial findings in PROGRESS.md
5. Mark task as COMPLETED when finished
6. Update TODO.md with any new tasks discovered

## Code Architecture

This is a React-based CV/resume template using Semantic UI React for styling. The application follows a simple container-component pattern:

### Main Structure (`src/App.js`)
The app renders sections in this order:
1. **Header** - Name, title, contact information
2. **Experience** - Work history and positions  
3. **Education** - Academic background
4. **Skills** - Technical skills grouped by category
5. **Achievements** - Extracurricular activities and awards
6. **Footer** - Version info and attribution

### Key Components (`src/components/`)
- `SectionItem` - Used for Experience and Education entries
  - Props: companyTitle, location, jobTitle, startDate, endDate, description, items, relevantItems
- `SkillRow` - Used for Skills section
  - Props: title, items, titleColumnWidth, dataColumnWidth, isNarrow
- `SectionTitle` - Section headers with consistent styling

### Container Components (`src/containers/`)
Each section (Header, Experience, Education, Skills, Achievements, Footer) has its own container component with hardcoded content.

### Styling
- Primary styling via Semantic UI React components
- Custom styles in `src/App.css` with print-optimized CSS classes
- Inline styles used throughout for specific layout needs
- Print-friendly styles with `.hideFromPrint` and `.noPageBreak` classes

### Configuration
- `src/constants.js` - Contains CV_VERSION and DATE for versioning
- `package.json` - Update `homepage` field for GitHub Pages deployment

## Content Customization

Content is **hardcoded** in the container components (not configuration-driven). To customize:
1. Edit container files in `src/containers/` directly
2. Replace inline content with your own information
3. Use existing component props structure for consistency
4. Update `constants.js` for version tracking

## GitHub Pages Setup

Ensure repository is configured for GitHub Pages:
- Source: "deploy from branch"
- Branch: "gh-pages" 
- Folder: "/ (root)"
- Update `homepage` URL in `package.json` with your GitHub username
